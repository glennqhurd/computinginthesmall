# Computing in the Small Week 1
Please click on this link to open the class notebook for this week.  This is a skeletal version and a fleshed out version will be added to the folder later in the week.  You can edit the notebook in Binder (a service for hosting Jupyter notebooks) any way you want, but be aware that you work will not be saved and so please take notes if you want to remember what you worked on.


Goals for week 1:

1. Demonstrate the ability to open the Jupyter notebook and use it to test code.

1. Learn about the "2x + 1" function.

1. Learn about the Collatz ("3x + 1") function.
