# Computing in the Small $\pi$ Day
Please click on this link to open the bonus $\pi$ day notebook.  We will not have time to cover this in class, but your teachers will be happy to field any questions.  It is 100% optional (as if anything was mandatory :-)) but we couldn't resist taking advantage of the holiday.

Goals for [Pi Day](https://www.piday.org/):

1. Learn something about approximating $\pi$.

1. Eat as many kinds of pie as possible.
