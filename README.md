# Computing in the Small
Welcome to Computing in the Small, with your teachers Lyman Hurd and Glenn Hurd.  The goal of the course is to show that systems defined by simple rules can have complex and unpredictable behavior.

There will be a folder per week and a README file will specify a Binder link that will lead you to an interactive copy of the Jupyter notebook for the week.
