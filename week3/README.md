# Computing in the Small Week 3
Please click on this link to open the class notebook for this week.

This week we will focus on Pascal's triangle.  This will be helpful when we learn about cellular automata and there was enough content to warrant breaking it out into its own lecture!  Pascal was not the first one to study the triangle with his name and other sources refer to it as Khayyam's Triangle, Yang Hei's Triangle, Tartaglia's Triangle. 

Goals for week 3:

1. Learn about Pascal's triangle, its history and some of its uses.
2. Examine the structure of Pascal's triangle mod 2 (the pattern of odd and even numbers).
